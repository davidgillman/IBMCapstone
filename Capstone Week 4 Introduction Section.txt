Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need 
to leverage the Foursquare 
location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems 
always target an audience and 
are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure 
that you explicitly describe 
your audience and why they would care about your problem.


Introduction/Business Problem Section


Imagine I am working for a restaurant entrepreneur who lives in Toronto.  
Let us call this person “Chef”.

Chef sees the cultural and financial similarities between New York and 
Toronto.  As eatery trends start in 
one city they are likely to be picked up in the other within a year.  The 
delay is usually due to other 
restaurant operators needing to observe the changes.  This takes time.

Chef wants to be ahead of that crowd and open a trendy restaurant several 
months earlier.  I have told 
Chef I can use Foursquare data for New York to spot the hottest trend in 
restaurants.

Being in Toronto, Chef needs to know the hot, trendy restaurant types in 
New York and then see what 
neighborhoods in Toronto do not have any of those types of restaurants.  
I will determine the 3 types of 
restaurants in New York that have the most trending indicated on 
Foursquare.

The problem is less exact than specific locations since factors such as 
amount of traffic in the area, 
pedestrian access, parking, frontage and specific retail location must be 
weighed.  However, using the 
postal code data is too fine grained.  I will use the clusters generated 
in Week 3 assignment to 
determine the best region of Toronto to investigate putting a new 
restaurant.

My project will guide the Chef (or other restaurant entrepreneurs) on 
opening new restaurants more 
quickly.  Reducing the time to open hot new locations in targeted areas 
puts the Chef (or other 
restaurant entrepreneurs) ahead of his competition.
