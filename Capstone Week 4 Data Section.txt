
Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute 
your idea. Remember that you 
will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or 
execute your idea. You can 
absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location 
data. So make sure that you 
provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data 
that you will be using, even if it 
is only Foursquare location data.



Data Section



The project happens in two phases both using Foursquare data.
The client wants to focus on restaurant trends centered on the borough of 
Manhattan in New York City.  

The first data set will be to identify a central point of Manhattan and 
then pull the hot trend data from 
Foursquare.  The hottest 3 types of restaurants will be identified and 
ranked.

The data from Foursquare will use the Foursquare Trending API filtered by 
a radius from a central 
Manhattan latitude and longitude.  The radius will likely be a distance 
similar to ½ of the distance 
between centroids in the Toronto area from the Week 3 assignment.

This is the first data set - the Trending API return data from New York.
 
From there all of those restaurants of the 3 identified types are pulled 
throughout Toronto.  This is the 
second data set using the Foursquare Places API.

Those restaurant locations distances from cluster 
centroids will be determined with the lowest density of location type by 
centroid being the best area to 
open a new restaurant.
